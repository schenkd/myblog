I hate writing about myself. I prefer to concentrate on the things around me rather than on me. 
But every blog probably also has an About me page where the author introduces himself. So also this one. 
But this About me should be different. I looked at a few others to get inspired and found out that actually only key data in a person's career are formally processed. 
This might underline the competence of a person, but for my taste it lacks a personality. I hope I can give you a little insight into my personality and thank you for your interest.

My name is David (or Dave) and I was born in 1992. The year which is called the International Year of Space by the United Nations. A possible cause for my enthusiasm for the universe and its nature. 
I grew up as the only child of a hard working and dutiful German father and a spirited and loving Spanish mother. My family are very skilled craftsmen and know almost everything. 
Except me. My attention I dedicated since my early childhood to the computer. My cousin gave me my first computer when I was 6 years old. Windows 98 with a 100 MHz Pentium processor. 
Hell yeah i loved that machine. And what is a boy this age doing with a computer? Right, he plays computer games. After I got Paint through I got age appropriate games for a boy like me like Doom 95, Doom 98 and GTA on disk. I was fascinated by the idea of how it is possible to use electricity and such a device to create these images that I watch on the monitor. 
Like in a movie only that I take part in it. I also had the experience of going on the internet with a 56K modem. During this time I learned a lot about patience and what 
it costs if you don't have an internet flatrate. I thought it was great that everyone on the Internet has the opportunity to build their own little section where they write about what they like. 
For this reason my interest in the technologies behind it began to grow. I started to build my own homepage in 2003. At that time a simple text editor, a little CSS and some HTML were enough as tools. 
At that time there were no great dynamic single-page-applications with react and a complex backend and a nosql-store. JavaScript was still a foreign word for me at that time. The good times. 

In 2008 I started my first job at a large international telecommunications company in bonn. There I started a three-year apprenticeship as an IT systems electronics engineer.
In the first year I was allowed to drive home to private customers and help them to set up their internet and ip-tv connection correctly. It was mainly handicraft work but to my surprise it was a great pleasure. 
On the one hand I loved to see how a telecommunication network is built up and on the other hand I always had a soft spot for working with people.
Already in the second year I was allowed to visit the business customers and gain insight into the different companies. The work became more demanding and less manual. I started to get deeper into the matter of network technology. 
After my successful training I went into the second level support for business customers. I was so proud. That was all I ever wanted at that time. 
I now belonged to a group of experts for the administration of our business customer networks. The job was in DÃ¼sseldorf and I commuted 1-2 hours there and back every day for work. 
But I enjoyed doing that because I loved my job.

After 1 1/2 years I got a job offer in Bonn in the technical headquarters. For the following 4 years my task was the monitoring of the national telecommunication network. I learned a lot during this time. 
How important it is to work as a team, try to optimize your work further and further and concentrate on the important things and automate the standard work. It has shaped my understanding of good quality work. 

Besides my job I studied information systems. Working full-time and studying on the side hasn't always been easy, but when I get excited about something I like to go the extra mile. 
During my studies I realized that my old passion for development is something I want to make my full time job. A colleague of mine asked me if I would be interested in joining him as a consultant in the company. 
I couldn't imagine consulting until then, but the job sounded like a new challenge that I really needed. That was in 2017 and since then I have been working as a consultant and have been involved in varied and exciting projects. 
I really enjoy getting an insight into companies and supporting them in finding the best solution for their challenges. I love the contact to other people and the cooperation with my highly motivated and dedicated colleagues. 
I love my job. Therefore I dedicate this blog to my work and the challenges I face every day. I hope my experiences can help you with your challenges.

Best regards David
