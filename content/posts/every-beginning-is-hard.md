If you can read this I think I finally managed to get my blog online. For many years now I've been thinking about having a blog in which I write reports, tips and little instructions about everyday challenges. 
A kind of working diary. I think the problem with blogs is not that you don't know what to write about, but rather that you don't know how to write about something. 
For my part, I've been thinking about how the blog should look like for far too long. I started a new project on Github, chose a new technology to try out and started to develop my own blog engine. 
After a short time I had already made my first experience with a new framework or language, but my blog engine was unfortunately never really productive. I think it is the urge of every developer to create something by himself.
