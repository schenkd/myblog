Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again.
Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking,  
Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically build a  
page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create or  
update your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they  
are edited, Hugo is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience  
for your websiteâ€™s end users and an ideal writing experience for website authors.

## Add some content

You can manually create content files (for example as content/<CATEGORY>/<FILE>.<FORMAT>)
and provide metadata in them, however you can use the new command to do few things for you (like add title and date):
```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```
